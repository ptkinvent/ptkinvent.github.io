                        You may have read in the news about Microsoft's recent
                        acquisition of GitHub. But what exactly
                        <i>is</i> GitHub, and why are some people up in arms
                        about its acquisition?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Is it a file sharing site like Dropbox? Confusingly,
                        even GitHub never really explains what it is&mdash;that
                        is, unless, you know what Git is.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Git</h3>
