                While working on new algorithms and data structures in robotics,
                it's often helpful to visualize data in 3D. Certainly, it's
                possible for our minds to comprehend much larger amounts of data
                and perform visual error-checking in 3D than in the console. But
                I've met many bright developers who feel daunted by tools like
                Unity and Unreal Engine and end up trying to visualize complex
                3D environments using 2D grayscale maps instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enter OpenSceneGraph (OSG). OSG is an open source,
                cross-platform 3D rendering library written in C++ that's much
                easier to get up and running. There's still a learning curve,
                but it's short enough to be covered in a blog post like the one
                you're reading.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Why not use a standard tool like Gazebo for this?" you may be
                wondering. Well, in most cases, especially in professional
                environments, you may not be building in ROS. Perhaps ROS will
                one day become widely adopted enough that we can rely on Gazebo,
                but such is still not the case today.

                This guide is meant to springboard those developers looking to
                visualize 3D scenes in a quick-and-dirty manner&mdash;we won't
                be worrying about realistic shadows, materials, and other
                effects. If that sounds like you, keep on reading!

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                I won't be getting into the installation of OpenSceneGraph. But
                for reference, after installation, if you have trouble linking
                your first project to the OpenSceneGraph library, here is a
                sample CMakeLists.txt file to get you started (don't worry, I
                was new to CMake when I started, too).

            <h3>Smart Pointers</h3>
            <p>
                Before we dive into building your first scene graph, just be
                aware that OSG ships with its own brand of smart pointers,
                called <code>osg::ref_ptr<></code>. Just like
                <code>std::shared_ptr<></code>, which you may be used to, these
                pointers maintain a count of how many times an object is
                referenced and will automatically delete the object when its
                reference count falls to zero. Unlike
                <code>std::shared_ptr<></code>, the reference count in OSG also
                increments when an object is added to the scene graph and
                likewise decrements when the object is removed. Generally, it's
                good practice to use these smart pointers as much as possible.
                You'll find in examples that even the helper methods for
                constructing OSG objects for us will generally return a smart
                pointer to the constructed object rather than a regular pointer.
                Good practices like these will help prevent memory leaks or our
                objects being deleted when we least expect it.
            </p>

            <h3>Nodes</h3>
            <p>
                First and foremost, OpenSceneGraph is about constructing a
                graph, and for the purposes of this guide we can abstract away
                the specifics of how that graph is actually rendered into the 2D
                picture that appears on your screen and worry instead about
                creating just that graph. In fact, let's simplify further: for
                most purposes, your scene graph will really just be a scene
                tree.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, a tree consists of nodes, one of which is the root. This is
                the root of your scene, and you'll see later that we specify
                <code>setSceneData(root)</code> to define the point where
                rendering begins. All other nodes will have one parent (in this
                guide, anyway) and zero or more children. There's two main types
                of nodes: group nodes and leaf nodes. Groups can have one or
                more children, and they may apply some sort of transform or
                special properties to all downstream children. Leaf nodes, on
                the other hand, cannot have children. They describe some sort of
                geometry or specific 2D/3D object in the scene, like a triangle
                or a <code>.3ds</code> model imported from a CAD program.
            </p>

            <h3>Geodes</h3>
            <p>
                With that, let's jump right in. Geodes are a special type of
                leaf node which define geometries; in fact geode is short for
                geometry node. The way to use these is to create one or more
                <code>osg::Drawable</code>s defining some geometry (like a line,
                triangle, sphere, text, etc.) and add it to your geode using
                <code>geode->addDrawable(geom)</code>. Then, add your geode to
                the scene graph under a group node with
                <code>group->addChild(geode)</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's expand on three types of drawables you can use inside
                geodes&mdash;geometries, shapes (yes, they're different), and
                text.
            </p>

            <h5>Geometries</h5>
            <p>
                Geometries are custom user-defined shapes. By combining
                individual shapes like triangles and quads, you can create
                shapes as simple as hexagons or as complex as pentagonal
                trapezohedrons&mdash;or really any shapes you can think of,
                including point clouds and nonconvex crescents. Let's start by
                creating a triangle.

    osg::ref_ptr<osg::Geometry> myTriangleGeometry = new osg::Geometry;

    // Define the triangle's 3 vertices
    osg::ref_ptr<osg::Vec3Array> vertices = new osg::Vec3Array;
    vertices->push_back(osg::Vec3(0, 0, 0));
    vertices->push_back(osg::Vec3(100, 0, 0));
    vertices->push_back(osg::Vec3(0, 0, 100));
    myTriangleGeometry->setVertexArray(vertices);

    // You can give each vertex its own color, but let's just make it green for now
    osg::ref_ptr<osg::Vec4Array> colors = new osg::Vec4Array;
    colors->push_back(osg::Vec4(0, 1.0, 0, 1.0)); // RGBA for green
    myTriangleGeometry->setColorArray(colors);
    myTriangleGeometry->setColorBinding(osg::Geometry::BIND_OVERALL);

    // Turn off lighting
    myTriangleGeometry->getOrCreateStateSet()->setMode(GL_LIGHTING, osg::StateAttribute::OFF);

    // Turn on blending
    myTriangleGeometry->getOrCreateStateSet()->setMode(GL_BLEND, osg::StateAttribute::ON);

    // Define the geometry type as 'triangles'
    myTriangleGeometry->addPrimitiveSet(new osg::DrawArrays(osg::PrimitiveSet::TRIANGLES, 0, vertices->size()));

    // Finally, let's add our triangle to a geode
    osg::ref_ptr<osg::Geode> myGeode = new osg::Geode;
    myGeode->addDrawable(myTriangleGeometry);

    // And now we can create a viewer to look at our geode
    osgViewer::Viewer viewer;
    viewer.setSceneData(myGeode);
    return viewer.run();

                If you build and run this, you should be able to launch a window
                with a green triangle that you can spin around by clicking and
                dragging your mouse. Play around with it. Try adding 6 vertices
                instead of 3 and change the primitive type from
                <code>TRIANGLES</code> to <code>LINE_LOOP</code>. Now switch it
                to <code>LINES</code>, or <code>LINE_STRIP</code> Can you tell
                what these do?

                In this case, we chose to <code>BIND_OVERALL</code>, meaning we
                assigned a single color to the entire geometry. But we can
                actually assign individual colors at each vertex&mdash;OSG will
                blend the colors together for you if you add two more colors in
                the <code>colors</code> array and replace
                <code>BIND_OVERALL</code> with <code>BIND_PER_VERTEX</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lighting is used to darken and lighten objects in the scene
                depending on the direction of the light source of the scene. For
                our purposes, they just make details hard to see so we turn them
                off. Blending enables helpful effects like transparency so we
                leave it on.
            </p>
            <p>
                By specifying <code>TRIANGLES</code> to the geometry, we've
                defined that we want to interpret every three vertices as a new
                triangle. Of course, there's plenty of other primitive types.
                Here's a non-exhaustive list to get you started:

            <h5>Shapes</h5>
            <p>
                A variety of other basic shapes exist for quickly adding 3D
                objects to scenes, such as <code>Sphere</code>,
                <code>Box</code>, <code>Cone</code>, and <code>Cylinder</code>.
                They behave similarly to geometries in that they are attached to
                geodes using <code>addDrawable()</code>.

            </p>

            <h5>Text</h5>
            <p>
                Adding text to scenes is done using the <code>Text</code> class
                in the <code>osgText</code> namespace. Simply create an
                <code>osgText::Text</code> object and attach it to a geode using
                <code>addDrawable()</code>. Common methods used with text are:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>setText()</code></li>
                    <li><code>setPosition()</code></li>
                    <li><code>setFont()</code></li>
                    <li><code>setColor()</code></li>
                    <li>
                        <code>setAxisAlignment()</code>&ensp;Place the text on the XY, YZ, XZ, or other planes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>setAlignment()</code>&ensp;Options here include centered, left-aligned, right-aligned, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>setCharacterSize()</code></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>

            <h3>Groups</h3>
            <p>
                As mentioned before, groups are simply a type of node in the
                scene graph which contain children. Some groups, like
                <code>osg::Group</code> don't have any special
                properties&mdash;they simply help organize your scene graph in
                an intelligible way. Others apply special properties to their
                children.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is a code snippet with a short example of how to use
                groups in your scene graph. To run the code snippet, you will
                need to download the example dataset for your version of
                OpenSceneGraph <a target="_blank"
                href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/index.php/download-section/data">here</a>,
                unzip it to a folder, and point an OSG-specific environment
                variable called <code>$OSG_FILE_PATH</code> to that folder so
                the files can be found at runtime. If you don't set
                <code>$OSG_FILE_PATH</code>, you'll have to provide paths to
                each model, like cessna.osg.

            <p>
                You might be thinking, "That covers adding objects to the scene,
                but how do you actually position them in the scene?". Well,
                there's two main ways of transforming objects in OSG:
                <code>PositionAttitudeTransform</code> and
                <code>MatrixTransform</code>. Both achieve the same results, but
                their interfaces differ.
            </p>
            <p>
                For PositionAttitudeTransforms, or PATs for short you apply a
                <code>setPosition()</code>, <code>setAttitude()</code>, and/or
                <code>setScale()</code> to transform all children downstream in
                the scene graph. Try to imagine how this could be used to
                construct a robot arm in OSG&mdash;a relatively linear scene
                graph where each linkage of the arm would be added under its own
                <code>osg::PositionAttitudeTransform</code>, which itself would
                be a child of the previous linkage of the arm. Changing the
                position or attitude of any linkage would automatically
                transform the downstream linkages.
            </p>
            <p>
                MatrixTransforms behave the same way, but rather than setting a
                position or attitude, you set a <code>Matrix</code> instead.

                Try running the following example to iteratively rotate a 3D
                model of a glider:

                In this case, we can see that the glider is translated along the
                x-axis and is rotating relative to the origin of the scene,
                marked by the set of axes. Note that <code>viewer.run()</code>
                in the previous examples was automatically attaching a
                manipulator to the scene for us. When we use
                <code>viewer.frame()</code>, we have to create and attach our
                own to enable zooming and panning.

            <h4>Switches</h4>
            <p>
                Switches are used to selectively hide or show objects in the
                scene. It's hard to find this written down anywhere, but it's
                generally not a good idea to <code>removeChildren()</code>
                from your scene graph often&mdash;rather, you should use
                <code>osg::Switch</code> or <code>node->setNodeMask()</code> to
                hide and show your nodes. To use a switch, initialize the
                switch, add it to the scene, give it some children, and use
                <code>setChildValue()</code> or <code>setSingleChildOn()</code>
                to make them visible or invisible.
            </p>

            <h4>LODs (Level of Detail)</h4>
            <p>
                LOD group nodes are used to make objects visible or invisible
                depending on the distance of the camera from the object. When
                you add a child, you also specify a range like so:
                <code>lod->addChild(node, 0, 1000)</code>. LOD nodes are often
                used for paging terrain data in and out&mdash;for example, when
                you zoom far out some high resolution terrain tiles can get
                replaced by lower resolution ones, putting less burden on the
                system and resulting in a smoother scene (all without the user
                knowing).

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Well, that's a whirlwind tour of OpenSceneGraph. Of course,
                there's much more to it, including handling mouse interactions
                using intersections, keyboard interactions using event handlers,
                other types of manipulators, and autotransforms and
                billboards&mdash;perhaps for another blog post. Until then,
                these principles alone will get you pretty far with quickly
                creating complex 3D environments to visualize your algorithms.
