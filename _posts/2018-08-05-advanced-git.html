                    <p>
                        With Microsoft's recent acquisition of GitHub, you may
                        be feeling more motivated than ever to learn git.
                        Finally, today's the day when you finally learn git! No

                        The first piece of good news is that you're in the right
                        place. We're going to go through the most common
                        commands one by one and, more importantly, when to use
                        them. The second is that git is probably the right tool
                        for your version control. It's incredibly powerful when
                        used correctly, and will definitely help you when you
                        have to collaborate on large software projects.
