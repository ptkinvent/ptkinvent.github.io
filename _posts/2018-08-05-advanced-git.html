            <p>
                As a modern software engineer, you probably have a good grasp of
                the fundamentals of Git, but there's actually a surprising
                amount more to the tool than you might think. So much so in fact
                that it might challenge the way you think of Git. For one thing,
                your commit history is much more fluid than you might
                assume&mdash;it isn't written in stone the way you're led to
                believe early on. This guide is about unlocking some of the
                hidden powers of Git and taking your version control to the next
                level. As such, it assumes you already have a good grasp of
                committing, branching, and merging. Ready? Good, let's start.
            </p>

            <h4>Remotes</h4>
            <p>
                You've probably read about the distributed nature of Git at some
                point, but have you ever actually experienced it? It's good to
                know how to handle origins flexibly in case you ever run into a
                situation where you need it. For example, your Git server might
                down for an extended period of time, or you may need to
                collaborate in a place without Internet access.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you need to, you can clone from a peer machine on the network
                using clone over SSH using

{% highlight sh %}
git clone ssh:gituser@hostname:/path/to/project
{% endhighlight %}

                Then ask the owner of the peer machine to enter their
                password&mdash;or alternatively, ask them to set up a new user
                on their machine as a temporary origin with a shared
                password&mdash;and you're good to go! Push and pull like normal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, you may run into a situation where code is being
                developed on a machine which doesn't have access to your Git
                server. Perhaps a contractor who doesn't have yet have building
                network access or a lab machine that doesn't connect to the main
                network. In this case, you would add the access-less machine as
                another remote of your project on your machine using

{% highlight sh %}
git remote add mylabmachine username@hostname[.domain.com]:path/to/project.git
{% endhighlight %}

                Check to make sure it got added correctly with <code>git remote
                -vv</code>. Now you can simply <code>git pull mylabmachine
                master</code> and <code>git push origin master</code> whenever
                you need to check the lab machine's code in to the master
                network.
            </p>

            <h4>Branching</h4>
            <p>
                As a mindful developer you should strive to keep your Git
                history as well-maintained as your code. There's a variety of
                techniques you can use, but be forewarned&mdash;some of them
                sound like heresey because they result in altered histories. You
                may even hear coworkers call these techniques evil, but the
                truth is that anything can seem evil if you attempt to use it
                without fully understanding how it works. Bear with me and
                you'll find they actually result in cleaner code bases and
                easier debugging when used properly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, as a general rule, if you do choose to alter your Git
                history, either work locally on a branch that isn't pushed, or
                wait until you're about to merge back to dev/master and your
                branch will be deleted right after the merge. <strong>Do not
                ever use</strong>
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git push --force # Don't do this. You'll lose friends.
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                to push your changes to the remote when collaborating. This will
                overwrite commits on the remote branch and could lead to
                unintentionally destroying someone else's work.
            </p>

            <h5>Moving Commits</h5>
            <p>
                Has it ever happened to you that you've committed to the wrong
                branch? It's okay, it happens to the best of us! Just don't
                <code>git push</code> yet. Checkout the branch you meant to
                commit on, then run
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                to copy over the accidental commit to this
                branch. Now go back to the other branch and run
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                with the hash of the last commit that should be on that branch.
                Now you can push your commit to the correct branch. Phew, no
                problem. Cherry-pick can help you out of tight spots, but be
                careful not to abuse it.
            </p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="offset-md-2 col-md-8">
            <p>
                For reference, <code>git reset --hard</code> will delete commits
                locally&mdash;you'd have to <code>git pull</code> to get them
                back from the remote. Using <code>git reset --soft</code>, on
                the other hand, will undo the commit but leave the changes from
                that commit staged. Useful when you realize your commit message
                has a typo but haven't pushed yet. (On that note, you can also
                use <code>git commit --amend</code> to add changes to the last
                commit and/or change the commit message.)
            </p>
            <h5>Stashing</h5>
            <p>
                You might already know this one, but Git's stash is incredibly
                helpful. It's used to save uncommitted changes without
                committing to be applied later, even in a different branch. For
                example, if you're trying to <code>git pull</code> but you have
                a possibly conflicting change that's preventing Git from
                pulling, <code>git stash</code> your changes so you can pull,
                then run <code>git stash pop</code> or <code>git stash
                apply</code> (pop will also delete the stash unless it causes a
                merge conflict). Now you can properly deal with merge conflicts
                if there are any.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can have multiple stashed changes. Run <code>git stash
                list</code> to see them all and <code>git stash show -p
                stash@{&#35;}</code> to view the stash in diff form, replacing
                '&#35;' with the ID of the stash you want. <code>git stash drop
                stash@{&#35;}</code> is used to delete a stash. It's very
                helpful when you have uncommitted changes preventing you from
                performing a Git action, e.g. checking out another branch. Use
                <code>git stash clear</code> to delete all stashes.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of these commands can be run without a stash ID&mdash;the
                action will simply apply to the topmost stash
                (<code>stash@{0}</code>). To keep your stashes from getting out
                of control, you should attach memorable messages when stashing.
                Use
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git stash save "My memorable message"
{% endhighlight %}

            <h5>Patches</h5>
            <p>
                Sometimes you need to move code around but can't or don't want
                to push it to a remote. Maybe it's test code that you want to
                send your colleague to debug, and you'd rather not push it, even
                as a WIP. In this case, you can write your changes into a patch,
                which is just a text file containing the diff. Simply run
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git diff > mypatch.patch
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                and your diff will be saved into the file. Send it to your
                colleague, and let them apply it to their copy of the project
                with
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git apply mypatch.patch
{% endhighlight %}

            <h5>Rebase</h5>
            <p>
                Finally, one of the most powerful tools in Git is called rebase.
                It has two main uses&mdash;rebasing on top of another branch and
                interactive rebase, which is the one that allows rearranging
                history.
            </p>
            <p>
                Say you've been working locally on an unpushed branch called
                topic, which initially branched from master. You see some new
                commits appear on master that are useful to you. At this point,
                you have two options&mdash;you could merge master into your
                branch, but if you have to do this often your branch's history
                will become difficult and hard to parse. Instead, in this case
                because your branch is unpushed, you have another option, which
                is rebasing (yes, it does exactly what it sounds like). Once
                you've fetched the new commits on master, simply run
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git rebase master
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                and voila! Your commits have now moved on top of master. If you
                encounter a conflict, don't fret; just resolve it like you would
                for a merge, then run <code>git rebase --continue</code> (Git
                will prompt you). Now your branch history will stay clean,
                you'll be able to trace commit history more easily across the
                project, and you'll be guaranteed to have a clean fast-forward
                when you merge back into master. As an added benefit, the
                commits related to your feature will stay together as a group
                instead of interspersed with many others in master.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Image -->
    {% include image.html path="img/blog-git-rebase.png" width="8" caption="Git rebase can be used instead of merge." %}

    <div class="row">
        <div class="offset-md-2 col-md-8">
            <p>
                As an aside, if you're working on a pushed branch but have some
                unpushed commits, you can pull your teammates' changes to that
                branch with <code>git pull --rebase</code> to rebase your
                commits on top of theirs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other rebase, interactive rebase, is an interesting feature
                that comes with great power/responsibility. Imagine that you've
                been working again on a branch called topic. You've been
                diligently marking commits with WIP to signify that they don't
                necessarily build, and you're getting ready to merge back to
                master soon. At this point, you might realize that the situation
                will never arise that someone wants to explicitly checkout one
                of the WIP commits, so why not combine them. This is called
                squashing; it's a feature within Git's interactive rebase. Now,
                if all your commits are unpushed, you can clean up your commits
                as you go without messing up anyone's history. Otherwise, you
                should only perform the interactive rebase when you're about to
                merge back to master <strong>and you'll be deleting the topic
                branch after</strong>. Run
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git rebase -i HEAD~#
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                replacing &#35; with the number of commits you want to
                rearrange. You'll enter the interactive rebase interface. You'll
                see instructions there, but in this interface you would type
                <code>s</code> or <code>squash</code> next to all your WIP
                commits to combine them with their downstream commits. You'll
                have an opportunity later to assign new commit messages to these
                super-commits. You can also rearrange and delete commits in this
                interface, but be careful not to lose any work. And that's it!
                You've successfully changed your Git history. Again, do not use
                <code>git push --force</code> when collaborating because you'll
                risk undoing someone else's work.
            </p>

            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>
                I hope that these techniques, whether they were life-changing or
                not, will help you develop better than ever before. For a more
                thorough guide, I'd encourage you to check out <a
                href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git</a>. Like I
                mentioned previously, I believe a great developer should
                maintain their version history just as fastidiously as their
                code. Not only does a clean history help out your teammates, but
                it also helps you when bug-hunting (and/or <code>git
                bisect</code>ing, still learning that one). Try out the commands
                in a test project to get used to them and you'll reap the
                rewards. Now git outta here!
