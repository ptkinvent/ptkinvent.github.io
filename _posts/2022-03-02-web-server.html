                These days, they say anyone and their grandma can create and
                launch a website. But having been through it a handful of times,
                I can say truthfully it's still kind of a mess. Perhaps it's
                even intentional&mdash;companies like SquareSpace and Wix thrive
                precisely because it's still so difficult! Even the best
                tutorials are generally scattered, don't explain the meaning
                behind each step, and often just unhelpfully link you to generic
                documentation. This post attempts to teach you to launch your
                own website in a maintainable and explainable way.
            </p>
            <p>
                You'll need some familiarity with command line tools. To be
                clear, this post is not about creating content for your website
                (HTML/CSS/JS). Instead, this tutorial will lead you through
                deploying your website once it's ready by launching a fresh AWS
                machine, setting up an NGINX web server, setting up a domain on
                Google Domains, and adding HTTPS using Certbot. If that sounds
                like what you've been searching for, read on!

            <h4>Part 1: Launching the Web Server</h4>
            <p>
                In the old days of Web 1.0, people used to run web servers from
                their own computers sitting inside their homes. These days, it's
                common practice to rent cloud compute on a virtual machine owned
                and maintained by a provider, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS),
                Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure. There aren't
                many differences between them, but just know that each cloud
                provider intentionally tries to lock you into their ecosystem,
                making it hard to change providers later. We'll use AWS for the
                purposes of this tutorial, sticking with the options that fall
                under <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/"
                target="_blank">AWS's Free Tier</a> so we can run our website
                for free for the first year.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Navigate to <a class="font-weight-bold"
                    href="console.aws.amazon.com/"
                    target="_blank">console.aws.amazon.com</a>
                    and log in/sign up.
                </li>
                <li>
                    From the Services menu, navigate to <span
                    class="font-weight-bold">EC2</span>. EC2 stands for Elastic
                    Compute Cloud and is where we will launch a virtual machine
                    which will become our web server.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click the orange <span class="font-weight-bold">Launch
                    Instances</span> button.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We're asked to choose an operating system. For the purposes
                    of this tutorial, we'll choose <span
                    class="font-weight-bold">Ubuntu Server 20.04</span>. We'll
                    leave the option on the right toggled to <span
                    class="font-weight-bold">64-bit (x86)</span>. Click <span
                    class="font-weight-bold">Select</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next, we're asked to choose how powerful of a machine we
                    want. For this tutorial, we'll choose the <span
                    class="font-weight-bold">t2.micro</span> since it's eligible
                    for the free tier. Click <span
                    class="font-weight-bold">Next: Configure Instance
                    Details</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nothing to do here! Click <span
                    class="font-weight-bold">Next: Add Storage</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Our machine currently has 8 GB of storage. You can choose up
                    to 30 GB if you like for free. Click <span
                    class="font-weight-bold">Next: Add Tags</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nothing to do here! Click <span
                    class="font-weight-bold">Next: Configure Security
                    Group</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In its current security configuration, this machine will
                    only allow SSH connections and nothing else. However, web
                    servers need to accept HTTP and HTTPS connections, so let's
                    add those. Click <span class="font-weight-bold">Add
                    Rule</span> and choose <span
                    class="font-weight-bold">HTTP</span> under Type. Click <span
                    class="font-weight-bold">Add Rule</span> again and choose
                    <span class="font-weight-bold">HTTPS</span> under Type.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </div>

    {% include image.html path="img/ec2-security-config.png" width="8" caption="Your security group configuration should now look like this." %}

    <div class="row">
        <div class="offset-md-2 col-md-8">
            <ol start="10">
                <li>
                    Click <span class="font-weight-bold">Review and
                    Launch</span> then <span
                    class="font-weight-bold">Launch</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A pop-up appears asking to select an existing key pair or
                    create a new key pair. Choose <span
                    class="font-weight-bold">Create a new key pair</span>. Set
                    the type to <span class="font-weight-bold">RSA</span>. Give
                    it any name, e.g. <span
                    class="font-weight-bold">personal-website</span>, and click
                    <span class="font-weight-bold">Download Key Pair</span>. You
                    can save the resulting .pem file anywhere, but I'd recommend
                    keeping it in <code>~/.ssh/</code>. This file is called an
                    Identity File and is necessary to SSH into your AWS machine.
                    You'll have to modify the permissions on this file before
                    you can use it with SSH. Run the following command in your
                    terminal:

{% highlight sh %}
chmod 400 <path/to/your/identity/file.pem>
{% endhighlight %}
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </div>

    {% include image.html path="img/ec2-key-pair.png" width="8" caption="Download your Identity File from this pop-up." %}

    <div class="row">
        <div class="offset-md-2 col-md-8">
            <ol start="12">
                <li>
                    Click <span class="font-weight-bold">Launch
                    Instances</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Give AWS a few minutes to spin up your new machine. Once
                    it's launched, you'll be able to see it on the EC2
                    dashboard. From the dashboard, click on <span
                    class="font-weight-bold">Instances</span> and click on the
                    <span class="font-weight-bold">Instance ID</span> of your
                    new machine. This will show information about your new
                    instance, including its <span
                    class="font-weight-bold">Public IPv4 address</span> which
                    you should note down.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Almost there! Now, let's SSH into our new machine and
                    install a web server. Apache and NGINX are popular free
                    ones&mdash;there isn't much difference so we'll use NGINX
                    for this tutorial. You'll need the IPv4 address of your
                    machine and the .pem file you downloaded earlier. Run the
                    following command from your terminal:

{% highlight sh %}
ssh -i <path/to/your/identity/file.pem> ubuntu@<your IPv4>
{% endhighlight %}

                    Note: If you'll be SSH-ing into your machine a lot, you can
                    set up a convenient nickname inside
                    <code>~/.ssh/config</code> so you don't have to type the
                    path to the .pem file and IPv4 information every time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We're now inside our brand new machine. It's good practice
                    to always run <code>sudo apt update</code> and <code>sudo
                    apt -y upgrade</code> in any new Ubuntu machine. This will
                    download updates and may take a couple minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once that's done, let's install NGINX with <code>sudo apt
                    install nginx</code>. Once it's installed, let's launch it
                    with <code>sudo nginx -s reload</code>. At this point, you
                    should be able to navigate to your server's IPv4 address in
                    your browser and see the NGINX welcome page!
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </div>

    {% include image.html path="img/nginx-welcome.png" width="8" caption="Your server is up and running if you can see this in your browser." %}

    <div class="row">
        <div class="offset-md-2 col-md-8">
            <ol start="17">
                <li>
                    At the moment, NGINX is serving a static HTML page located
                    on your server at
                    <code>/var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html</code>. You can
                    edit this file&mdash;go ahead and try&mdash;but it's a bit
                    cumbersome because you'll need superuser privileges every
                    time. Let's point NGINX to a new folder in our home
                    directory called <code>html</code> instead. Run:

{% highlight sh %}
cd ~
mkdir html
chmod 755 html/
cp /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html html/
{% endhighlight %}

                    Now, let's point NGINX to our new folder. Edit the file at
                    <code>/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default</code> using your
                    favorite editor with sudo privileges. This is the
                    configuration file for our web server. Find the line that
                    says <code>root /var/www/html</code> and modify it to point
                    to our new folder. It should now say:

{% highlight sh %}
...
root /home/ubuntu/html;
...
{% endhighlight %}
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can now edit your
                    <code>~/html/index.nginx-debian.html</code> file as you
                    please! It's common practice to shorten this filename to
                    <code>index.html</code>
                    for convenience if you'd like. Don't worry, it won't break
                    anything.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Part 2: Pointing a Domain at the Web Server</h4>
            <p>
                Hooray! Now our web server is running, but our visitors would
                have to type our IP address into their browser to visit it,
                which isn't a great experience. Instead, we'd like to point a
                custom domain to our server. This part is much easier&mdash;just
                have your IPv4 address handy from earlier. Typical websites for
                purchasing domains include GoDaddy, BlueHost, and Google
                Domains. For reference, AWS also has their own domain management
                system called Route 53, but it's confusing and difficult to use.
                Let's use Google Domains for this tutorial.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Navigate to <a class="font-weight-bold"
                    href="https://domains.google.com" target="_blank">Google
                    Domains</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click <span class="font-weight-bold">Get a new domain</span>
                    and purchase something you like. Take your time, I'll be
                    here.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Navigate to <span class="font-weight-bold">My domains</span>
                    and click on your new domain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    From the left menu, choose <span
                    class="font-weight-bold">DNS</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Under <span class="font-weight-bold">Custom records</span>,
                    let's add two new records&mdash;one for
                    <code>example.com</code> and one for
                    <code>www.example.com</code>.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            For the first one, leave
                            <span class="font-weight-bold">Host name</span>
                            empty. Under Type, select <span
                            class="font-weight-bold">A</span> because we're
                            creating what's called an A-name record. Leave <span
                            class="font-weight-bold">TTL</span> as
                            3600&mdash;that's just a "time to live" parameter we
                            don't need to worry about. Finally, under <span
                            class="font-weight-bold">Data</span>
                            enter your server's IPv4 address.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Create one more that's identical to the previous one
                            but whose <span class="font-weight-bold">Host
                            name</span> is <code>www</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Hit <span class="font-weight-bold">Save</span>.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                </li>
                <li>
                    That's it! Give it a few minutes, then try navigating to
                    your domain from your browser. You should see your website!
                    If you're having trouble, I'd recommend looking into the
                    <code>dig</code> command line tool to debug.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Part 3: Adding HTTPS (Optional)</h4>
            <p>
                You may have noticed your browser complaining that your website
                is insecure. This is because modern websites use HTTPS for
                encrypting traffic, but our website is only configured for HTTP.
                HTTPS is technically optional, but not really because these days
                Google won't even surface your website in search results unless
                it has HTTPS enabled.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many providers of HTTPS certificates. Let's use
                <a target="_blank" href="https://certbot.eff.org/">Certbot</a>
                since it's easy and free. Note that Certbot will prompt you to
                renew your certificate every 90 days.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    SSH into your machine.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Run:

{% highlight sh %}
sudo apt install -y python3-certbot-nginx
{% endhighlight %}
                </li>
                <li>
                    Run Certbot:

{% highlight sh %}
sudo certbot --nginx
{% endhighlight %}

                    Certbot should lead you through a few steps:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Enter your email so Certbot can remind you to renew
                            your certificate every 90 days.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Then enter the domain name you purchased, e.g.
                            <code>example.com</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Finally, allow Certbot to modify your NGINX
                            configuration. As a result, Certbot will edit
                            <code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code>
                            to redirect anyone trying to connect to your website
                            insecurely over HTTP to connect over HTTPS instead.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                </li>
                <li>
                    You'll need to create a new NGINX configuration file for
                    your website. The name of the file is typically the same as
                    your domain name. Run the following:

{% highlight sh %}
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/
sudo touch mywebsitename.com
{% endhighlight %}

                    Edit the file we just created called
                    <code>mywebsitename.com</code> using your favorite editor
                    (vim, nano, etc.) with sudo privileges. Add the following
                    content inside, replacing all six instances of
                    <code>mywebsitename.com</code> with your domain name:

{% highlight sh %}
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name mywebsitename.com www.mywebsitename.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name mywebsitename.com www.mywebsitename.com;

    root /path/to/html;
    index index.html;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/mywebsitename.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/mywebsitename.com/privkey.pem;
}
{% endhighlight %}
                </li>
                <li>
                    We can put multiple configurations inside
                    <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available</code>, but NGINX will only
                    run the one(s) pointed to by the file inside
                    <code>/etc/nginx/sites-enabled</code>. We'll now create a
                    symbolic link, which is just a file that points to another
                    file, to point to our configuration. Run:

{% highlight sh %}
cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
sudo rm default
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/mywebsitename.com mywebsitename.com
{% endhighlight %}
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reload NGINX to apply the updated configuration with:

{% highlight sh %}
sudo nginx -s reload
{% endhighlight %}

                </li>
                <li>
                    Your website now has HTTPS! Navigate to your website in your
                    browser to check&mdash;you should see the "insecure
                    connection" icons/messages disappear. It may take a reload
                    or two.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Next Steps</h4>
            <p>
                Now that your website is launched, how should you actually build
                your content? Well, that's beyond the scope of this tutorial,
                but it depends on how simple or sophisticated of a website you
                need.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're just putting up a single page with no forms, you can
                write raw HTML/CSS/JS in your <code>index.html</code> file
                without relying on any other tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to put up multiple static pages (like a blog or
                project portfolio), you can use a static website generator like
                <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> (which is what this
                website uses) or <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. These
                tools save you from having to add your header and footer to
                every page by hand, and have free themes you can use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, if you're planning to run a complex app with forms and
                user log in, you should build a web app using a tool like <a
                target="_blank" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>
                or <a target="_blank"
                href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/">Flask</a>,
                which use Python. These require some additional
                setup&mdash;perhaps to be covered in another blog post&mdash;but
                will plug right into your current configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
                For now though, congratulations netizen, you have your very own
                website! Happy serving!
