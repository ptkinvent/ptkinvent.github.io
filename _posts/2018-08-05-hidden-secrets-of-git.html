                As a modern software engineer, you probably have a good working
                knowledge of the most common Git commands&mdash;committing,
                branching, and merging. But there's actually much more hidden
                depth to Git than you might expect. So much so, in fact, that it
                could change the way you work. For one thing, your commit
                history is much more fluid than you might assume&mdash;it isn't
                quite written in stone the way most beginner tutorials might
                lead you to believe.
            </p>
            <p>
                This post is about understanding the fundamental ideas behind
                Git, unlocking some hidden features, and taking your version
                control to the next level. As such, it assumes you already have
                a decent grasp of committing, branching, and merging. It's also
                a helpful reference for me personally&mdash;there's a few super
                rarely-used but helpful commands here that I repeatedly forget
                the syntax for.
            </p>

            <h4>Global Gitignore</h4>
            <p>
                Let's start with something you may already know. You're probably
                aware that if you create a file called
                <code>.gitignore</code> in your Git project and add some ignore
                rules, Git will automatically ignore any files that match those
                rules. What you may not know is that you can create a global
                ignore file which will apply globally across all projects. Try
                creating one in your home directory that looks like this:
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Force columns to break to new line -->
        <div class="w-100"></div>

        <div class="col-md-2 d-none d-md-block image-caption">
            <p>~/.gitignore</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
{% highlight sh %}
# Global gitignore

# Build files
*.bin

# Editor-specific files
.idea/
.vscode/
{% endhighlight %}
            <p class="image-caption-sm d-md-none">~/.gitignore</p>

            <p>Note that you can name your file anything and keep it anywhere.
            Then, simply run:</p>

{% highlight sh %}
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>and all files that match will be ignored in all situations. It's
            recommended to keep editor-specific ignore rules here; this prevents
            every team member from adding their own editor- and
            workspace-specific rules to every project.</p>

            <h4>Git Grep</h4>
            <p>
                In large projects, it's often very slow to use regular grep to
                find a piece of text in a folder. Fortunately, Git ships with a
                tool called <code>git grep</code>, which will skip untracked
                files to speed up search. Run:
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git grep "search term"
{% endhighlight %}

            <h4>Remotes</h4>
            <p>
                You might have also heard about the distributed nature of Git,
                but have you ever actually taken advantage of it? It's good to
                know how to handle remotes flexibly in case you ever run into
                the odd situation where you need it. For example, if your Git
                server goes down for a day or you're in a place without network
                access, you can continue collaborating with your teammate by
                adding their machine as a remote. This can also be useful, for
                example, if you're working with a contractor developing code for
                you who isn't allowed access to the corporate intranet.
            </p>
            <p>
                If it's a new repository, rather than cloning from GitHub, you
                can clone from a peer machine on the same network over SSH using:

{% highlight sh %}
git clone ssh:gituser@hostname:/path/to/project
{% endhighlight %}

                Then you'll have to ask the owner of the peer machine to enter
                their password, and you're good to go! Push and pull like
                normal. Pro-tip: Ask them to set up a new user on their machine
                with a shared password and have them push/pull to a repository
                owned by that user. You generally don't want to push/pull to a
                repository someone works on directly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, the repository may already exist on your machine
                and you want to add your colleague's machine as another remote.
                In this case, use:

{% highlight sh %}
git remote add my_other_remote username@hostname[.domain.com]:path/to/project.git
{% endhighlight %}

                Check to make sure it got added correctly with <code>git remote
                -vv</code>&mdash;you should now see two remotes listed. Now you
                can simply <code>git pull my_other_remote master</code> and
                <code>git push origin master</code> whenever you need to pull
                code from your colleague's machine and sync it with the origin.
            </p>

            <h4>Stashing</h4>
            <p>
                Git's stash is incredibly helpful. It's used to save uncommitted
                changes to be applied later, even to a completely different
                branch. For example, very often when you're trying to <code>git
                pull</code> it will fail because you have a conflicting change
                that's preventing Git from pulling. In this case, you can
                <code>git stash</code> your changes, then
                <code>git pull</code>, then run <code>git stash pop</code> or
                <code>git stash apply</code> (pop is the same as apply but also
                also deletes the stash unless there is a conflict). Now you can
                properly deal with merge conflicts if there are any.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can have multiple stashed changes. Run <code>git stash
                list</code> to see them all and <code>git stash show -p
                stash@{&#35;}</code> to view the stash in diff form, replacing
                <code>&#35;</code> with the ID of the stash you want. <code>git
                stash drop stash@{&#35;}</code> is used to delete a stash. It's
                very helpful when you have uncommitted changes preventing you
                from performing a Git action, e.g. checking out another branch.
                Use <code>git stash clear</code> to delete all stashes.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of these commands can be run without a stash ID&mdash;the
                action will simply apply to the topmost stash
                (<code>stash@{0}</code>). To keep your stashes from getting out
                of control, you should attach memorable messages when stashing.
                Use
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git stash save "My memorable message"
{% endhighlight %}

            <h4>Patches</h4>
            <p>
                Sometimes you need to move code around but can't or don't want
                to push it to a remote. Maybe it's test code that you want to
                send your colleague to debug, and you'd rather not push it, even
                as a WIP commit. In this case, you can write your changes into a
                patch, which is just a text file containing the diff. Simply run
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git diff > mypatch.patch
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                and your diff will be saved into the file. Send it to your
                colleague, and let them apply it to their copy of the project
                with
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git apply mypatch.patch
{% endhighlight %}

            <h4>Branching</h4>
            <p>
                As a mindful developer you should strive to keep your Git
                history as maintanable as your code. There's a variety of
                techniques you can use, but be forewarned&mdash;some of them
                sound like heresey because they result in altered Git histories.
                It's common to hear colleagues call these techniques evil, but
                the truth is that anything can seem evil if attempting to use it
                without fully understanding how it works. Bear with me and
                you'll find they actually result in cleaner code bases and
                easier debugging when used properly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only rule you need to follow is, if you do choose to alter
                your Git history, either make sure it only affects a local set
                of unpushed commits, or wait until you're about to merge and
                your branch will be deleted right after the merge.
                <strong>Unless you know what you're doing, do not ever
                use</strong>
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git push --force # Don't use this unless you really know what you're doing
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                to push your changes to the remote when collaborating. This will
                overwrite commits on the remote branch and could unintentionally
                destroy someone else's work, so be extremely careful.
            </p>

            <h5>Amend</h5>
            <p>
                Say you've just committed your code, only to realize it doesn't
                compile because you missed a semicolon somewhere. Should you
                make another commit just for the semicolon fix? Well, if you
                haven't pushed yet, you're in luck! Make the fix, stage the
                file(s), and use:
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git commit --amend
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                You'll end up with the fix amended to your last commit. Note
                that the hash of that commit is no longer the same after the
                amend, which is why this technique only works if you haven't
                pushed&mdash;you're changing Git's history. Note that you can
                also use this technique to just edit the last commit's message.
            </p>

            <p>
                What happens if you have fast fingers and accidentally amended a
                commit instead of creating a new one? Fortunately, Git has your
                back. The old commit is still in Git's reflog, which keeps a
                history of where your <code>HEAD</code> was recently. View the
                reflog with:
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git reflog
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                <code>HEAD</code> should currently be pointing to your amended
                commit, but <code>HEAD@{1}</code> should be pointing to your
                pre-amend commit, which still exists but is not part of any
                branch. To undo the amend, you need to reset back to
                <code>HEAD@{1}</code>, i.e. the commit <code>HEAD</code> was
                pointing to before now. You don't want to lose the amended
                changes, so we'll use a soft reset. Finally, we commit the reset
                files, but only with the details of that <code>HEAD@{1}</code>
                commit. This should restore you back to your pre-amend state:
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git reset --soft HEAD@{1}
git commit -C HEAD@{1}
{% endhighlight %}

            <h5>Moving Commits</h5>
            <p>
                Has it ever happened to you that you've committed to the wrong
                branch? It's okay, it happens to the best of us! Just don't
                <code>git push</code> yet. Run:
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git checkout topic
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                to copy over the accidental commit to this
                branch. Now run
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git checkout master
git reset --hard HEAD~
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                Now you can checkout your <code>topic</code> branch and push as
                normal. Phew, no problem. Cherry-pick can help you out of tight
                spots, but be aware that it's very easy to abuse and get you
                into even more trouble.

            <p>
                For context, <code>git reset --hard</code> will delete commits
                locally&mdash;you'd have to <code>git pull</code> to get them
                back from the remote. Using <code>git reset --soft</code>, on
                the other hand, will undo the commit but leave the changes from
                that commit staged.
            </p>

            <h5>Rebase</h5>
            <p>
                Finally, one of the most powerful tools in Git is called rebase.
                It has two main uses&mdash;rebasing on top of another branch and
                interactive rebase. Both involve changing history, so should be
                not be used after you've pushed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Say you've been working locally on an unpushed branch called
                topic, which initially branched from master. You see some new
                commits appear on master that you'd like to have in your branch.
                At this point, you have two options&mdash;conventional wisdom
                would have you merge master into your branch, but this tends to
                make your commit history a tangled mess of back-and-forth
                merges. Instead, you can rebase if you haven't yet pushed. Once
                you've fetched the new commits on master, simply run
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git rebase master
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                and voila! Your commits have now moved on top of the latest
                master. If you encounter a conflict, don't fret; just resolve it
                like you would for a merge, then run <code>git rebase
                --continue</code> (Git will prompt you). Now your branch history
                will stay clean, you'll be able to trace commit history easily
                across the project, and you'll be guaranteed to have a clean
                fast-forward when you merge back into master. As an added
                benefit, the commits related to your feature will stay together
                as a group instead of interspersed with many others in master.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Image -->
    {% include image.html path="img/blog-git-rebase.png" width="8" caption="Git rebase can be used instead of merge." %}

    <div class="row">
        <div class="offset-md-2 col-md-8">
            <p>
                As an aside, if you're working on a pushed branch but have some
                unpushed commits, you can pull your teammates' changes to that
                branch with <code>git pull --rebase</code> to rebase your
                commits on top of theirs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interactive rebase, on the other hand, is a great feature that
                comes with great power/responsibility. Imagine you're working
                again on a branch called topic. You've been diligently marking
                commits with WIP to signify that they don't necessarily build,
                and you're getting ready to merge back to master soon. At this
                point, you might want to combine multiple WIP commits into one
                that actually builds correctly. This is called squashing; it's a
                feature within Git's interactive rebase. If all your commits are
                unpushed, you can clean up your commits as you go without
                messing up anyone's history. Run:
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
git rebase -i HEAD~#
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                replacing <code>&#35;</code> with the number of commits you want
                to rearrange. You'll enter the interactive rebase interface.
                You'll see instructions there for squashing, rewording, editing,
                etc commits. You can also rearrange and delete commits in this
                interface, but be careful not to lose any work. And that's it!
                You've changed Git history. If you do change history after it's
                been pushed, you can use
                <code>git push --force</code>, but be extremely careful because
                you risk undoing someone else's work.
            </p>

            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>
                I hope that these techniques, life-changing or not, will help
                make you a better developer. For a more thorough guide, I'd
                recommend checking out <a
                href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git</a>. I believe a
                great developer should maintain their source tree just as
                fastidiously as their code. Not only does a clean history help
                out your teammates, but it also helps you when bug-hunting
                (enter <code>git bisect</code>, a topic for another post). Try
                out the commands in a test project to get used to them and
                you'll reap the rewards. Now git outta here!
