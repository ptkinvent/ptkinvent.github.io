                Databases contain the long-term memory of your app server. They
                can be tricky, but don't have to be scary! Out-of-the-box,
                Django gets you started with a SQLite database, which works
                great for local development and small web apps in production.
                However, when it's time to scale up your app, you may find
                yourself wondering whether it's time to move to something more
                sophisticated, such as AWS RDS.
            </p>
            <p>
                How do you know when it's time to move to RDS? Well, for one
                thing, if your website is receiving more than 5-10 simultaneous
                visitors, your single EC2 machine may struggle to handle all the
                traffic. In that case, you should consider enabling EC2
                auto-scaling, which allows AWS to automatically spin up and down
                additional EC2 instances to keep up with demand. But in order to
                enable EC2 auto-scaling, you'll need to have a centralized
                database for all the EC2 instances to talk to. When this
                happens, it's time to move to RDS.
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of this blog post is to guide you through a
                migration from your SQLite database to a PostgreSQL database
                hosted in AWS RDS. If that sounds like what you need, read on!
            </p>
            <h4>Part 1: Launching an RDS Instance</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Navigate to <a href="https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/">https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/</a>.</li>
                <li>Scroll down to "Create database" and click "Create database."</li>
                <li>
                    Select:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Engine options: <code>PostgreSQL</code></li>
                        <li>Master username: <code>postgres</code></li>
                        <li>Templates: <code>Free tier</code></li>
                        <li>DB instance identifier: <code>my-database-name</code></li>
                        <li>Master username: <code>postgres</code></li>
                        <li>Master password: <code>some_secure_password</code></li>
                        <li>Connectivity: <code>Don't connect to an EC2 compute resource</code></li>
                        <li>Public access: <code>Yes</code></li>
                        <li>Database authentication: <code>Password authentication</code></li>
                        <li>Additional configuration: Initial database name: <code>tutorial_db</code></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Select 'Create database.'</li>
                <li>
                    Once created, copy the endpoint hostname (ends in
                    <code>.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com</code>) and port number
                    from the console and store them as environment variables in
                    your terminal:

{% highlight sh %}
export RDS_NAME="my-database-name"
export RDS_USER="postgres"
export RDS_PASSWORD="some_secure_password"
export RDS_HOST="<your hostname>"
export RDS_PORT="5432"
{% endhighlight %}
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Next, we need to edit the security rules for this database to
            allow incoming connections from our EC2 machine.</p>

            <ol start="6">
                <li>From the RDS console, select the security group corresponding to your RDS instance.</li>
                <li>Select 'Edit inbound rules'.</li>
                <li>Add a rule that allows connections of type <code>PostgreSQL</code> from the security group of your EC2 instance.</li>
                <li>Add another rule that allows connections of type <code>SS</code> from the security group of your EC2 instance.</li>
                <li>Select 'Save'</li>
            </ol>

            Great! Now your RDS instance is setup.

            <h4>Part 2: Connecting the RDS Instance to EC2</h4>
            <p>
                Ideally, we want to continue testing our app locally using
                SQLite while allowing the production EC2 server to communicate
                with RDS. We can enable this in our <code>settings.py</code>
                file by replacing the default values for <code>DATABASES</code>
                with:
            </p>

{% highlight py %}
...

if DEBUG:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': os.environ['RDS_NAME'],
            'USER': os.environ['RDS_USER'],
            'PASSWORD': os.environ['RDS_PASSWORD'],
            'HOST': os.environ['RDS_HOST'],
            'PORT': os.environ['RDS_PORT'],
        }
    }
...
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                This code reads values from our environment variables and uses
                them to connect to our RDS machine during production. Next, run:
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
pip install psycopg2 # or psycopg2-binary
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                We can test the connection is working by using:
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
python manage.py dbshell
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                If everything worked, we should get a PostgreSQL prompt allowing
                us to query the newly created SQL database. But hang on, there's
                no tables yet!
            </p>

            <h4>Part 3: Loading Tables and Data into RDS</h4>
            <p>
                Now that everything's connected, the final step is initializing
                our database with the tables it needs to get started. If we want
                to start fresh with an empty database, simply run:
            </p>

{% highlight sh %}
python manage.py migrate
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>
                Otherwise, if we want to bring data over from our old SQLite database, run these commands:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    For this step, temporarily point the terminal to the old SQLite database (e.g. by fudging the <code>if</code> statement we made in <code>settings.py</code>). Then, run:

{% highlight sh %}
python manage.py dumpdata > data.json
{% endhighlight %}

                </li>
                <li>
                    Now, point the server back to the new RDS machine. Then, run:

{% highlight sh %}
python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb # Creates all the tables without filling out the django_migrations table
{% endhighlight %}

                </li>
                <li>
                    We also need to manually delete some default data in our newly created RDS instance. Run:

{% highlight sh %}
python manage.py shell
> from django.contrib.conttentypes.models import ContentType
> ContentType.objects.all().delete()
{% endhighlight %}
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, we can load the data from our <code>data.json</code> file into our new database. From the terminal, run:

{% highlight sh %}
python manage.py loaddata data.json
{% endhighlight %}
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>To confirm our data has made it into the database, we can run:</p>
{% highlight sh %}
python manage.py dbshell
> \dt
{% endhighlight %}

            <p>If all is well, we should get a list of all our tables. Feel free to query them using SQL statements to confirm all your data is there, such as: <code>select * from django_migrations;</code></p>
            <p>If everything looks good, you're done with your database migration! Congratulations, and happy coding.</p>
