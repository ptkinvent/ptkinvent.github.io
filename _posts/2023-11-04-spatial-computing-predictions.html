                While Meta has been investing heavily in the future of
                virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) for years now, the vision of
                the future wasn't clear to me until Apple unveiled their Vision
                Pro headset to the world just a few months ago. Potentially, we
                can draw some parallels to the rise of past computing platforms
                and predict some market trends. Having some background in
                business and technology, I wanted to record some predictions
                that have been bouncing around my mind in case they're helpful
                to someone else. It's also personally interesting to compare how
                well we can predict future markets based on past analagous ones!
            </p>
            <h4>Target Market</h4>
            <p>
                The main use case that recently sold me on the future of mass
                adoption of VR/AR was the strength of productivity use cases
                from Apple's presentation. Positioning a headset as a potential
                laptop replacement, with productivity features for office
                documents as well as personal consumption features for online
                shopping and video streaming, with a familiar-looking operating
                system, makes for a very compelling buy for the average consumer
                (once the price comes down, which it will). I've recently been
                made aware of similar productivity features in the Meta
                headsets, but their branding and positioning have mainly focused
                on their social and fitness features rather than productivity,
                which seem like weak use cases for a hefty investment in a new
                device for a consumer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Does this mean that VR/AR headsets will completely replace PCs
                for productivity? Some things are just more natural on a
                laptop&mdash;like in-person collaboration. Certainly, students
                may continue to use laptops for many years to come, while
                hybrid-workplace businesses simultaneously move away from
                issuing laptops to heasets for their employees. Why not issue a
                $1000 headset where your employees can bring their entire
                workspace home instead of a $1000 laptop plus the cost of
                several bulky monitors?
            </p>
            <p>
                The following predictions are based on arcs we've seen with
                historical computing platforms. As Apple elegantly put it during
                their announcement of the Vision Pro, first came the rise of
                personal computing, then mobile computing, and now we find
                ourselves at the beginning of spatial computing. They appear
                very analagous, both in terms of technology and market forces.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the way, by branding their technology as "spatial computing,"
                it appears Apple is attempting to sidestep the negative branding
                around AR/VR, mixed reality, and metaverses. For convenience,
                let's stick with their nomenclature for this post.
            </p>

            <h4>The Winners</h4>
            <p>
                Based on what we've seen in personal and mobile computing, we
                can venture a guess as to which companies will command the
                strongest market forces in spatial computing. We know based on
                historical computing platforms that it will require a few major
                pieces: a headset-maker, a chip-maker, and an OS-maker. The new
                players here might be around low-power, portable LIDAR-makers,
                but if LIDAR-makers that supply the self-driving vehicle
                industry are any indication, they probably won't be a strong
                enough market force to command the others, so we can leave them
                out. We've seen that Apple is well-positioned to release a
                headset where they own every piece of this puzzle (including the
                LIDAR sensors), but what about everybody else?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>OS-makers:</strong> In terms of creating a competing OS,
                Microsoft and Google will perhaps race to capture the market,
                although it remains hard to predict whether they'll be
                open-sourced (e.g. Android model) or licensed (e.g. Windows
                model) to hardware manufacturers. It would be great to see
                Microsoft learn from their mistakes with Windows Phone OS and
                come out ahead as the competing OS of choice in spatial
                computing, but they may be too busy working with OpenAI to look
                up right now.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Headset-makers:</strong> In terms of hardware, we can
                probably point to the usual suspects as becoming big players in
                the spatial computing era. Samsung, Motorola, HTC, Sony, Xiaomi,
                OnePlus, and Huawei all have potential to become compelling
                headset-makers powered by someone else's OS, analagous to the
                mobile computing market. What about HP, Dell, and Lenovo? Well
                PCs don't share as many parts with headsets compared to
                smartphones, so it's difficult to predict whether PC makers can
                adapt, build relationships with the right chip-makers, and ramp
                up new supply chains in time to keep up&mdash;it's a very tall
                order. Can we expect Microsoft and Google to also build their
                own headsets? Certainly, both of them dabble in hardware. Will
                they release their own headsets up-front or wait for the other
                hardware-makers to build the first iterations first? It's hard
                to predict, but they appear to have enough funding and expertise
                to expand vertically if they so desire. The ideal position is
                probably Apple's where they own every vertical, but they're also
                so uniquely good at this compared to Microsoft and Google.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Chip-makers:</strong> Qualcomm stands out as the sole
                mobile chip-maker that can hold a candle to Apple's chips today.
                Their latest Snapdragon chips appear competitive with Apple
                Silicon in terms of power consumption and compute. Broadcomm has
                unfortunately been the victim of too much controversy to be a
                compelling player in this space.
            </p>

            <h4>The Not-winners</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Laptop-makers:</strong> It's hard to imagine consumers
                in a couple years owning both a laptop and a spatial computing
                headset because so many of the benefits and use cases are
                identical. There may be some niche use cases, like for
                consultants, who might prefer to work sometimes on a headset so
                they can spread out their work on large screens during long
                plane rides, and sometimes on a laptop where they can share
                ideas with a colleague or a client more easily. For the rest of
                the world, however, buyers will likely view laptops and headsets
                as substitutes and only purchase one instead of both. This
                indicates that laptop-makers stand to lose market share to
                headset-makers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Simultaneously, it seems unlikely headsets will eat into the
                smartphone market. In the near term, there isn't a lot of
                compelling work yet on headsets that work well in outdoor,
                mobile environments. Apple showed only one outdoor use case in
                their announcement: a father walking outside with his headset
                and recording a 3D video of his daughter playing in the front
                yard, but it looked positively dystopian&mdash;people probably
                (hopefully) won't be doing this with their headsets. That's not
                to say it's impossible in the long-term&mdash;reception to
                Meta's sunglasses has certainly been more positive than that of
                Google Glasses&mdash;but there's still no screen or many of the
                other things that make smartphones so useful. Perhaps one day
                the technical challenges can one day be overcome to resolve
                this, but for the near term spatial computing does not appear as
                big a threat to the smartphone market as it does for the PC one.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>GPU-makers:</strong> GPUs are great for rendering
                complex 3D environments, but are likely too bulky, hot, and
                power-inefficient to be a good fit for a computing device that
                needs to live on your head. For this reason, it's unlikely that
                GPU chip-makers will be able to ride the wave of spatial
                computing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Intel:</strong> Intel failed to cash in on the
                smartphone chip market, and I'm guessing they'll fail to adapt
                again. Sorry Intel, if you can prove me wrong I'll make you
                brownies.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Meta:</strong> Despite being (too) early to the market
                and trying their best to spark interest in VR/AR, Meta's
                headsets may fall by the wayside since they lack experience
                mass-producing at the scale of the other hardware-makers.
                Hardware is difficult&mdash;just ask Tesla. Instead, Meta's
                expertise is in building social features, so they may be more
                likely to build the social networking app of choice if they're
                able to build a compelling Metaverse accessible by all headsets.
                There's still a pretty penny to be made advertising in the era
                of spatial computing, but just as Meta failed to command enough
                of the smartphone market to set their own privacy and data
                collection rules, so too will Meta likely be relegated to just a
                software-maker role in the spatial computing era with no
                influence on data collection practices at the hardware level.
                Another win for all our data privacy, perhaps.
            </p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>
                If all of this sounds rather unimaginative, it's because it is.
                At this point, we've witnessed two historical arcs in the
                personal and mobile computing markets, so we should roughly know
                how this works by now&mdash;I've assumed the market forces will
                essentially be the same as before. The main assumption where
                I've made use of my creative license is around headsets
                disrupting the PC industry much more than the smartphone
                industry in the short term. Much (or none) of this may not come
                to pass as outlined, but as unpredictable as advances in
                technology have become common&mdash;see ChatGPT&mdash;it's
                refreshing and interesting to find a familiar pattern in
                technology and try to predict for the sake of predicting.
