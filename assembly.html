                    I built this robot with Peerapat Luxsuwong, Meagan Hiatt,
                    and Adria Fung as part of a final project at WPI for a class
                    called RBE 3001: Unified Robotics III. The project was to
                    make a robot to pick weights off an assembly line and sort
                    them by weight. The skills we implemented involved
                    programming a serial manipulator from the microcontroller up
                    using embedded programming, inverse kinematics, and PID
                    control.

                    We were given an electronics board with the microcontroller
                    and several aspects included as well as the arm and conveyor
                    belt. We attached an infrared sensor and used it to detect
                    the distance between the arm and an incoming object on the
                    belt. Using inverse kinematics, our arm could grab an
                    incoming block about 95% of the time. The robot then
                    extended itself out horizontally and obtained the weight of
                    the block it was holding by sensing the current through the
                    lower motor. Since the current is proportional to the torque
                    in the motor, the robot could determine if the block was
                    heavy or light and sort it accordingly.

                    Several other components came into play during the
                    project, including the timers, ADC, DAC, linear motor
                    drivers, current sensors, USART and SPI communications.
