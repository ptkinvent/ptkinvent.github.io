                    The Major Qualifying Project, or MQP, is a project at WPI in
                    a student's area of study meant to give the student a
                    real-world engineering experience. In my senior year, I
                    chose to build an autonomous ground vehicle for my MQP with
                    Professor Alexander Wyglinski.

                    With the price of sensors and computing steadily decreasing
                    year after year, affordable self-driving automobiles are
                    starting to become a reality. This MQP aimed to imagine a
                    divergent take on autonomous vehicle technology by
                    challenging modern vision algorithms rather than pursue
                    expensive sensors like LIDAR. Although sensors like LIDAR
                    have dominated recent ventures, their price, bulk, and
                    vulnerable location atop autonomous vehicles could hinder
                    their uptake in the future. As a result, this project sought
                    instead to pursue vision-based object-recognition and
                    navigation. For this project, a 1995 electric golf cart was
                    acquired for prototyping.

                    Significant upgrades had to be made to its design in order
                    for it to become autonomous. Because of the large scale of
                    this project, the project was broken down into separate
                    subsystems, each of which were worked on separately to be
                    combined sometime in the future. The different systems
                    requiring modifications are shown below. My work on the
                    project involved the three electromechanical subsystems
                    outlined in orange&mdash;the stereoscopic cameras, the
                    automated steering mechanism, and the automated braking
                    mechanism. Each of these subsystems posed its own unique
                    challenges and had to be dealt with differently.

                <p>
                    Raspberry Pi cameras were used for the steroscopic cameras,
                    since they were cheaply available and readily able to be
                    connected to a wireless network through Raspberry Pi
                    computers. A mounting solution was required for the
                    Raspberry Pi cameras and computers. Creating a mount was
                    more difficult than originally anticipated, since the
                    requirements called for, for example, ensuring that the
                    stereoscopic cameras would always point in exactly the same
                    direction. The final design, after going through five
                    iterations, is shown modeled in CAD below. The red plate
                    holding the Raspberry Pi computers and cameras can be easily
                    removed by pinching a spring-locked mechanism and sliding it
                    out.

                    The final design is shown below; tests showed that the
                    design worked well and the cameras were held rigidly. The
                    adjustable legs allowed us to try attaching the cameras to
                    different locations on the golf cart.

                <p>
                    Next, the steering system needed to be modified to allow the
                    computer to control it. This involved attaching a motor to
                    the dashboard of the golf cart (since there was no space
                    under the hood) using a chain and sprocket system. The
                    appropriate torque and speed calculations were done, and a
                    motor was acquired. A multiturn potentiometer was used for
                    position feedback and was attached with its own sprocket.
                    The potentiometer sprocket was chosen to maximize the
                    resolution of the data coming out of the sensor.

                    Once everything was mounted, the final tests showed the
                    speed and torque of the system had surpassed the
                    requirements. Translucent acrylic plates were placed on
                    either side of the sprockets for aesthetics, to protect the
                    components and the passengers, and to decrease the chance of
                    the chain slipping off the sprockets.

                    Finally, the brakes on the golf cart were automated to allow
                    the computer to control them. A non-backdrivable van door
                    motor was chosen for its high torque and low speed. For
                    safety, a new mechanism was designed to allow the brake
                    pedal to override the computer control. The design, shown
                    below in CAD, is such that the motor pulls on the red block
                    with a pair of steel ropes. The red block collides with a
                    collar which pulls the hooked rod forward, engaging the
                    brakes. However, the brake pedal can also pull on the hooked
                    rod without fighting against the motor, making the mechanism
                    backdrivable.

                    The system was messy and difficult to mount since the golf
                    cart had to be propped up with a car jack, but the final
                    design worked well within the given time and force
