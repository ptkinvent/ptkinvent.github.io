                    FIRST is an international organization that operates
                    robotics competitions for grade-school students. Their most
                    popular is the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), which takes
                    place every January. Thousands of students spend 10 weeks
                    with their teams building a 125-lb robot to play a 3 vs. 3
                    game that changes every year. The students are encouraged to
                    use 3D printing, metalworking techniques, CAD, and Java
                    programming to design and build their robots.

                    Although I'd been on a robotics team in high school, we
                    competed in the smaller FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)
                    competition. When I moved to Pittsburgh recently, I wanted
                    to pass on the robotics knowledge I had gained and sought
                    out a local FRC team: Sarah Heinz Advanced Robotics Program
                    (Team SHARP) based out of the Sarah Heinz House located in
                    the North Side of Pittsburgh.

                    I took a keen interest in understanding the programming
                    team's major challenges and quickly learned that their
                    biggest hurdle every year was lack of time with the robot
                    because the hardware design took a lot of time. This had led
                    to flaky software in the past and no time to tackle more
                    complex logic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leveraging my industry experience, I explained to the team
                    that we could build a simulation of the robot to experiment
                    until the real robot was finished. We set to work and
                    ultimately built something resembling a videogame that
                    helped springboard the programming team in the 2020 season.

                    The system works as three separate modules communicating
                    over fast UDP using JSON. The first mimics an Xbox
                    controller (so the students wouldn't always be forced to
                    share a real one), the second runs their custom Java code,
                    and the third runs the physics simulation of the robot and
                    field. For the physics simulation, I chose to use
                    OpenSceneGraph for lightweight 3D visualization and Box2D
                    for the physics.

                    Just a few weeks later, the simulator solved an unforseen
                    problem: after the pandemic hit, unfortunately all the FRC
                    competitions were canceled for the year and Team SHARP
                    didn't get to compete at all. The students still yearned to
                    meet and continue working on the robot, especially over the
                    summer, but could not use the lab&mdash;so I launched an
                    online lab using the simulator!

                    To teach the students about autonomous robotics, I added a
                    simulated LIDAR to the physics simulation. Over 10 short
                    weeks over the summer, we built a highly sophisticated AI
                    that could distinguish robots from balls on the field,
                    collect and score balls, and avoid hitting other robots
                    without any human intervention. We shared our results with
                    the rest of the community to some amazing feedback. The
                    students are continuing to use the code and are planning to
                    purchase a $100 LIDAR with the same specs as the simulated
                    one to attempt to automate their gameplay in 2021.
