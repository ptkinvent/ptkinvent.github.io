                <p>
                    Sikorsky Aircraft was founded in 1923 and is the oldest
                    helicopter company in the world. In fact the founder, Igor
                    Sikorsky, produced the first viable helicopter in the United
                    States in the 1930s. After a long and respected legacy of
                    building universally-loved Black Hawks and presidential
                    aircraft, Sikorsky ventured into autonomous aircraft in
                    2011. The team was able to acquire an S-76 commercial
                    helicopter and outfitted it with fly-by-wire and advanced
                    flight controls. A robust safety-critical software fallback
                    system gained them FAA approval allow experimental software
                    on the aircraft.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gains in Sikorsky's autonomous aviation led DARPA to create
                    the DARPA ALIAS (Aircrew Labor In-cockpit Automation System)
                    program with Sikorsky, Aurora Flight Sciences, and Lockheed
                    Martin. (At the time, Sikorsky belonged to United
                    Technologies.) After three rounds, Sikorsky emerged as the
                    sole competitor in the program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the main reasons Sikorsky's system was so successful
                    in the ALIAS program is because it was intended from the
                    get-go to for commercialization, not for prototyping a
                    one-off research platform. The core software was written to
                    obey hard real-time constraints for the purpose of running
                    in an RTOS, and the supporting software modules were written
                    with safety-criticality and eventual certification in mind.

                    I built this musical robot for David Nu&ntilde;ez &mdash; it
                    will be used for researching the efficacy of music for
                    forming relationships with robots. I put a lot of work into
                    designing the robot's form around its function, an important
                    component of human-robot interactions, as I learned. Many of
                    the contours are inspired by those of old phonographs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I began by sketching a few forms out on paper with David,
                    then went through a few iterations in SolidWorks until the
                    design was mechanically plausible and had an aesthetically
                    pleasing yet functional form.

                    The parts were laser-cut and waterjet from stock sheets of
                    acrylic and oak wood. The phonograph-like horn was
                    3D-printed and spray-painted with multiple coats.

                <p>
                    After constructing the first prototype, I made many
                    modifications to the design before building a second
                    prototype with smoother joints and better motion overall.

                    The final design features six degrees of freedom, which will
                    allow the robot to move fluidly, a must in social robotics.
                    Two of the motors are high-torque in order to manage the
                    weight of the head of the robot; two more servos in the head
                    are very small and lightweight in order to reduce the
                    weight; and the last two servos are medium-sized to handle
                    proper rotation of the body and the rolling of the head.
                    This second design is more robust and puts less strain on
                    the joints. David Nu&ntilde;ez will be taking the robot to
                    the Opera of the Future group at the MIT Media Lab to
                    perform experiments with.
