                <p>
                    In 1939, the world's first practical helicopter took flight
                    in Stratford, Connecticut. It was piloted by Igor Sikorsky,
                    a prolific inventor and the founder of Sikorsky Aircraft.
                    After a long and distinguished legacy of building the
                    universally-recognized Black Hawk and several presidential
                    aircraft, Sikorsky Aircraft ventured into autonomous
                    aviation in 2011. A small team with the backing of the
                    leadership acquired an S-76 commercial helicopter and
                    outfitted it with fly-by-wire and advanced flight controls.
                    A robust safety-critical software fallback system gained the
                    aircraft FAA approval to run experimental software, forming
                    the foundation for the Autonomy team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rapid gains and proofs-of-concept in Sikorsky's venture led
                    DARPA to launch the DARPA ALIAS (Aircrew Labor In-cockpit
                    Automation System) challenge with Sikorsky, Aurora Flight
                    Sciences, and Lockheed Martin as competitors (Sikorsky had
                    not yet been acquired by Lockheed Martin). After three
                    rounds, Sikorsky emerged as the winner with a smart copilot
                    and automation kit for fixed-wings and rotorcraft. One of
                    the major reasons our system was so successful was because
                    it was geared for certification and commercialization, not
                    for prototyping and research. The core software was written
                    to obey hard real-time constraints, and the supporting
                    software modules were written with safety-criticality and
                    certification in mind.

                    The test aircraft, called SARA (Sikorsky Autonomous Research
                    Aircraft), was outfitted with three LIDAR sensors and a
                    multitude of cameras. The main LIDAR had a range of 1
                    kilometer and was used for collision avoidance and landing
                    zone detection. The software was designed to be as
                    aircraft-agnostic as possible, and consisted of
                    sophisticated motion planners and perception systems.

                    One of the challenges posed by the ALIAS program was to not
                    only make the aircraft autonomous, but optionally
                    piloted&mdash;meaning, firstly, that the system needed to
                    behave in-line with the expectations of a human pilot, and,
                    secondly, that the system needed to allow some kind of human
                    input as suggestions to the motion planning. The team was
                    able to deftly overcome this challenge and the result proved

                    My work at Sikorsky consisted mainly of algorithm
                    development in perception and motion planning; I researched
                    and implemented novel data structures and algorithms for our
                    application, including AABB trees, octrees, and signed
                    distance fields. I also worked on LIDAR simulation and
                    calibration.

                    The road ahead for Sikorsky is bright. The team recently got
                    FAA approval to let non-pilots fly the aircraft from inside
                    the cockpit (see <a target="_blank"

                    and the kit has already been demonstrated to work well on
                    several different kinds of aircraft. The kit was also ported
                    to a UH-60 Black Hawk with tighter integrations into its
                    systems to allow even more sophisticated autonomy.
