                    ABB is a manufacturer of industrial robots, those used in
                    factories for assembling, welding, painting, and cutting
                    parts on assembly lines, such as those used for making cars.
                    The distribution center in Bangalore designs
                    customer-specific grippers for these robots and travels to
                    install these robots on-site.

                <p>
                    My project involved programming a robot to apply stickers to
                    the outside surface of barrel-shaped objects for a customer.
                    I began by working with a team to design a gripper in CAD
                    which would be able to control a sticker roller.

                    Once this was complete, I used inverse kinematics and some C
                    programming to help generate the path I needed the robot to
                    follow, then simply programmed the robot using the robot's
                    controller, which used a fill-in-the-blank style of
                    programming, to make the robot follow the desired
                    trajectories. After some troubleshooting, I went with the
                    team and personally helped to install and later troubleshoot
                    the robot at the customer's site.

                    Later on, I also worked with a welding robot, a parallel
                    manipulator for sorting chocolates into boxes, and a robot
                    arm with a vision system for checking workpieces for
                    manufacturing defects.
