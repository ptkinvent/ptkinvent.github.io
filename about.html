                    <section>
                        <p>
                            I'm a robotics engineer working on self-driving cars
                            at Uber, and I've always been passionate about
                            robotics engineering. Previously, I was at Sikorsky
                            Aircraft for 4 years working on autonomous aircraft
                            on a DARPA project called ALIAS. Prior to that, I
                            graduated from Worcester Polytechnic Institute with
                            two Bachelor's degrees in Robotics and Mechanical
                            Engineering.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my free time, I practice web design, electronics,
                            programming, and some woodworking. I've always held
                            a strong belief in the importance of mixing
                            engineering sciences with vibrant arts. I consider
                            myself a lifelong student and I'm attracted to
                            environments where I am continually learning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also enjoy giving back to the community through
                            volunteer work; I've performed magic shows,
                            volunteered at the Museum of Science in Boston, and
                            done graphic design work for <a
                            href="http://www.essenceofindia.org/">Essence of
                            India</a>, an annual celebration of classical Indian
                            culture and heritage in my hometown.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My interests are ever-expanding&mdash;I enjoy
                            reading, traveling, building, photographing,
                            driving, building sound systems, playing table
                            tennis, and having chill sessions with friends. I'm
                            also a fan of usability and UI/UX design.

                        <p>
                            I designed this website on my own and coded it
                            on top of
                            <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter's
                            Bootstrap</a> templates and the <a
                            href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> framework.
                            It was my first foray into HTML and CSS, and it's
                            been a lot of fun. Thanks to the powers of
                            Bootstrap, this website is fully optimized for your
                            mobile display, as well. Enjoy!
