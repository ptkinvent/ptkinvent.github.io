                        <p>
                            I'm deeply passionate about robotics and
                            entrepreneurship. I started my career after
                            graduating from Worcester Polytechnic Institute
                            (WPI), earning dual Bachelor's degrees in Robotics
                            and Mechanical Engineering. My first job was at <a
                            href="{% link _projects/sikorsky.html %}">Sikorsky
                            Aircraft</a> designing software for autonomous
                            helicopters for the DARPA ALIAS program. Then, I
                            went to <a
                            href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/atg/research-and-development/perception-and-prediction/"
                            target="_blank">Uber ATG</a> to design software for
                            self-driving cars. From 2020-2022, I studied at UC
                            Berkeley earning dual MBA/MEng degrees, after which
                            I became a Product Manager working on self-driving
                            cars at <a href="https://waymo.com"
                            target="_blank">Waymo</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Outside of work, I enjoy giving back to the
                            community through volunteer work; I've <a href="{%
                            link _projects/frcsim.html %}">mentored a FIRST
                            Robotics team</a>, volunteered at the Museum of
                            Science in Boston, and done some graphic design work
                            for
                            <a href="http://www.essenceofindia.org/"
                            target="_blank">Essence of India</a>, an annual
                            celebration of classical Indian culture and heritage
                            in my hometown.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my free time I practice badminton, photography,
                            and woodworking. I've always thrived at the
                            intersection of disciplined engineering and vibrant
                            arts, so I'm especially drawn to environments where
                            I can continue learning both.

                        <p>
                            I designed the theme for this website on my own and
                            coded it up using
                            <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/"
                            target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a> and <a
                            href="https://jekyllrb.com/"
                            target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. It was my first foray
                            into HTML/CSS in 2011, and it's been a lot of fun.
                            Thanks to the powers of Bootstrap, this website is
                            fully optimized for your mobile display as well.
                            Enjoy!
