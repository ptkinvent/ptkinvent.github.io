                    <section>
                        <p>
                            I'm a robotics engineer working on autonomous
                            aircraft at Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, and I'm
                            very passionate about robotics design engineering. I
                            graduated from Worcester Polytechnic Institute with
                            two bachelor's degrees in Robotics Engineering and
                            Mechanical Engineering.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my free time, I practice web design, electronics,
                            programming, and basic graphic design. Something
                            that makes me unique is my strong belief in the
                            marriage of the engineering sciences and vibrant
                            arts. I'm attracted to environments where I learn
                            new things often.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also enjoy giving back to the community through
                            volunteer work: I've performed magic shows,
                            volunteered at the Museum of Science in Boston, and
                            done graphic design work for <a
                            href="http://www.essenceofindia.org/">Essence of
                            India</a>, an annual celebration of classical Indian
                            culture and heritage in my hometown.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My interests are wide and ever-expanding &mdash; I
                            enjoy reading, traveling, building things,
                            photography, sports cars, sound systems,
                            engineering, economics, philosophy, table tennis,
                            hanging out with friends, and introspection. I'm
                            also a big fan of usability and user experience
                            design. For me, the purpose of life is to become the
                            best possible version of myself and to make the
                            people around me happy. I also believe robots can
                            teach us a lot about what it means to be human. I
                            dream of one day using my knowledge to create robots
                            to aid humans.

                        <p>
                            I designed and built this website on my own and
                            coded it with the help of <a
                            href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter's
                            Bootstrap</a>. It was my first foray into HTML and
                            CSS, and it was definitely an enriching experience.
                            Thanks to the powers of Bootstrap, this website is
                            fully optimized for your mobile display as well.
                            Enjoy!
                        </p>
