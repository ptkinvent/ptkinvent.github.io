                        <p>
                            I'm a product manager in the robotics and
                            self-driving space with MBA/MEng degrees from UC
                            Berkeley. Before Berkeley, I was at Uber writing
                            software for self-driving cars. Before that, I was
                            at <a href="{% link _projects/sikorsky.html
                            %}">Sikorsky Aircraft</a>
                            designing software for autonomous helicopters for
                            the DARPA ALIAS program. Prior to that, I was at
                            Worcester Polytechnic Institute earning dual
                            Bachelor's degrees in Robotics and Mechanical
                            Engineering.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Outside of work, I enjoy giving back to the
                            community through volunteer work; I've <a href="{%
                            link _projects/frcsim.html %}">mentored a
                            FIRST Robotics</a>, volunteered
                            at the Museum of Science in Boston, and
                            done some graphic design work for
                            <a href="http://www.essenceofindia.org/"
                            target="_blank">Essence of India</a>, an annual
                            celebration of classical Indian culture and heritage
                            in my hometown.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my free time I practice photography,
                            woodworking, and badminton. I've always
                            pursued a balance of engineering rigor
                            and creative arts, so I'm especially drawn to
                            environments where I can continue learning both.

                        <p>
                            I designed the theme for this website on my own and
                            coded it up using
                            <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/"
                            target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a> and <a
                            href="https://jekyllrb.com/"
                            target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. It was my first foray
                            into HTML/CSS in 2011, and it's been a lot of fun.
                            Thanks to the powers of Bootstrap, this website is
                            fully optimized for your mobile display as well.
                            Enjoy!
