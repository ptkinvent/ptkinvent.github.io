                    <section>
                        <p>
                            I'm a robotics engineer working on autonomous
                            aircraft at Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, and I'm
                            very passionate about robotics design engineering. I
                            graduated from Worcester Polytechnic Institute with
                            two bachelor's degrees in Robotics Engineering and
                            Mechanical Engineering.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my free time, I practice web design, electronics,
                            programming, and some graphic design. Something that
                            makes me unique is my strong belief in the
                            importance of mixing engineering sciences and
                            vibrant arts. I'm attracted to environments where I
                            learn new things often.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also enjoy giving back to the community through
                            volunteer work: I've performed magic shows,
                            volunteered at the Museum of Science in Boston, and
                            done graphic design work for <a
                            href="http://www.essenceofindia.org/">Essence of
                            India</a>, an annual celebration of classical Indian
                            culture and heritage in my hometown.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My interests are ever-expanding&mdash;I enjoy
                            reading, traveling, building, photographing,
                            driving, turning up sound systems, playing table
                            tennis, and having chill sessions with friends. I'm
                            also a fan of usability and user experience design.

                        <p>
                            I designed this website on my own and coded it with
                            the help of <a
                            href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter's
                            Bootstrap</a> and <a
                            href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. It was my
                            first foray into HTML and CSS, and it's a
                            continually enriching experience. Thanks to the
                            powers of Bootstrap, this website is fully optimized
                            for your mobile display as well. Enjoy!
