# Prateek Sahay's Personal Website #
Welcome to the code behind my personal website! My website is hosted at
prateeksahay.com and psahay.com.

I developed this website to archive my favorite projects I've been lucky enough
to work on. For now all the styling you see is written by hand on top of
Twitter's Bootstrap. The website is statically generated by Jekyll.

## Installation ##
```sh
gem install sass
gem install jekyll
gem install bundler
```

## Build ##
`bundle exec jekyll build --destination <path/to/destination>`
