# Prateek's Personal Website #
Welcome to the inner workings of my personal website! My name is Prateek and
I'm a young engineer at the beginning of my career. I studied robotics and
now work at Sikorsky Aircraft in Connecticut developing autonomous software
technologies for Black Hawks and other aircraft. 

I developed this website to archive my favorite projects I've been lucky
enough to work on. As I learn more about web frameworks like Django I'd like
to keep updating this site, but for now everything you see is written by hand
on top of Twitter's Bootstrap.
