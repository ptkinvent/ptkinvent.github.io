# Prateek's Personal Website #
Welcome to the code behind my personal website! My name is Prateek and
my website is hosted at prateeksahay.com or psahay.com. I studied robotics
and now work at Sikorsky Aircraft in Connecticut developing autonomous
software technologies for Black Hawks and other aircraft. 

I developed this website to archive my favorite projects I've been lucky
enough to work on. As I learn more about web frameworks like Django I'd like
to keep updating this site, but for now everything you see is written by hand
on top of Twitter's Bootstrap.
