                            They call it the curse of knowledge&mdash;when
                            you've known something so long that you can't
                            remember ever not knowing it in the first place. You
                            become a bad teacher, impatient because you can't
                            understand how someone else could have so much
                            trouble with a basic concept.

                            I started writing software in college after growing
                            up with several software developers. I felt pretty
                            lost for a while (what's a Boolean?), and without a
                            lot of guidance at home I didn't even know how to
                            get started. I hope to use this blog as a way to
                            document my journey since then, along with some of
                            my biggest pitfalls in the hopes of inspiring
                            someone else and providing the much-needed guidance
                            a student needs.
