                            They call it the curse of knowledge: when you've
                            known something for so long that you can't remember
                            ever not knowing it in the first place. You become a
                            bad teacher, impatient because you can't understand
                            how someone else could have so much trouble with a
                            basic concept.

                            I got started in software later than some of my
                            friends, so I can appreciate how difficult the
                            learning curve can be sometimes. I hope to use this
                            blog as a way to document some of the hardest parts
                            of my journey and some of my biggest pitfalls in the
                            hopes of helping someone else.
